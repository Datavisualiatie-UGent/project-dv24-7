<div class="grid grid-cols-2" style="grid-auto-rows: 504px;">
  <p>Magic: the gathering (MTG) is the most popular trading card game in the world. It has been captivation players since its inception in 1993 by mathematician Richard Garfield. The cards are printed and published by Wizards of the Coast. MTG combines strategic gameplay with rich lore, making it a beloved staple of both casual and competitive gaming communities. Despite the age of the game, MTG has great longevity and is still very popular to this day with new cards and sets being released frequently <br> <br>
  In MTG, players assume the role of powerful wizards known as Planeswalkers, using decks of spell cards representing magical spells, creatures, artifacts, and lands to defeat their opponents. With thousands of unique cards and a dynamic, ever-evolving metagame, MTG offers endless opportunities for creativity, strategic thinking, and skillful play. <br> <br>
  As an addition to the physical card game, Magic: The Gathering also provides a free online mode in 
<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena">MTG Arena</a>. This serves as an easy and accessible playstyle for new players to learn how to play the game. It boasts a comprehensive tutorial and uses the same rules, cards and sets as the TCG.
